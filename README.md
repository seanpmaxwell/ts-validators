# ts-validators


This is not a library, this is just a collection of validator functions I frequently use and I'm putting here for sharing purposes. If you're using the `jet-schema` library you might find this collection of functions pretty useful.
<br/>


All the validator functions are in the `./src/validators.ts` file.

Abbreviations used in naming functions:
- `Opt` optional, (`value | undefined`)
- `Nul` nullable, (`value | null`)
- `Nish` nullish, (`value | null | undefined`)
